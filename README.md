# advent-of-code-2022

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [mkaminski86][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository I try to refresh my [Kotlin][kotlin] skills by solving the Advent of Code puzzles for the year 2022.


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
